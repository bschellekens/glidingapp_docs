We welcome contributions from all pilots! If you spot missing information, unclear instructions, or have tips to share, you can help improve the documentation:

1. Click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of any documentation page to suggest changes directly on GitHub (we will publish the latest version after a short review)
2. For larger contributions, fork the repository and submit a pull request with your improvements.
3. If you prefer, you can also email your suggestions to [contact@gliding.app](mailto:contact@gliding.app)

Your feedback and expertise help keep our docs accurate and useful for the whole gliding community.
