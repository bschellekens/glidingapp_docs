# Setup your launch point

## Overview

Setting up the launch point requires configuring hardware, software, and user accounts to enable flight logging at the airfield. The launch point setup connects three components: a **Launch Tower user account** for shared access without personal credentials, **OGN receiver hardware** for automatic flight detection, and **FLARM database registration** to match aircraft signals with club records.

## Launch Tower device

GlidingApp runs as a website in a web browser on a tablet or laptop located at the launch point. We recommend installing a browser like Chrome to run GlidingApp. The tablet or laptop should have an internet connection to connect with the GlidingApp server.

Often, when migrating to GlidingApp, clubs already have a digital launch administration, and the hardware there is often good enough to run GlidingApp. If nothing is available, our advice would be to set up a tablet with a 3G data card and a large power bank in the launch bus or tower to manage the day.


## Launch Tower user

The **Launch Tower user** is a shared account dedicated to launch point operations. Created automatically during club setup, this account enables flight logging without requiring personal login credentials. The account has permission "Can perform launch administration during the day" but only on open days - after a day closes, all flight edits require admin permission and are logged to individual user accounts.

The launch tower user typically remains logged in on a dedicated tablet or laptop at the launch point throughout the flying day. Access requires a **temporary password** generated by administrators at the start of operations.

A temporary password is generated for this user (under **Flights**). A 4-digit code, valid for 5 minutes, is generated with which you can log in to the laptop/tablet present at the launch tower.

**Important:** This user remains logged in throughout the season. Generating a temporary password should be a one-off event at season start. 

## OGN Receiver Hardware

An **OGN (Open Glider Network) receiver** captures FLARM signals from gliders and transmits position data for automatic flight detection. The receiver reduces manual timekeeping by detecting takeoff and landing events through altitude changes and ground speed analysis. OGN integration is optional - clubs can operate with manual timekeeping - but significantly reduces launch marshal workload.

### Installation Considerations

**Line-of-sight requirements:** The receiver must have direct visibility to both launch and landing areas. Clubhouses sometimes have poor line-of-sight to the launch point, particularly at airfields with multiple fields across hills or with tree barriers. Consider mounting the receiver on the mobile launch tower if clubhouse location provides inadequate coverage.

**Antenna placement:** Mount the antenna as high as practical with 360-degree visibility. Rooftop mounting typically works well, but verify visibility to launch area specifically. Gliders fly lower than airliners (affecting range compared to ADS-B reception) and obstacles significantly reduce detection range.

### Commercial and DIY Options

Pre-built OGN receivers are available from vendors offering plug-and-play installations. These systems include proper enclosures, power supplies, and pre-configured software.

DIY installations cost significantly less (~€50-100 vs €300-500) but require technical competence. The [OGN project](http://wiki.glidernet.org/ogn-receiver-installation) provides detailed guides including:

- Ready-to-use Raspberry Pi SD card images
- Hardware assembly instructions
- Antenna building guides (self-made collinear antennas)
- Software configuration documentation

DIY installation typically takes 2-4 hours for someone comfortable with Linux and basic electronics. The Raspberry Pi image simplifies software setup - write the image to an SD card, configure station name and coordinates, and connect hardware.

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify the receiver appears on the [OGN receiver list](http://wiki.glidernet.org/list-of-receivers). The receiver should show online status within minutes of powering on. Configure club settings in the application with the receiver name to enable availability monitoring in the flight logging interface.

Test automatic detection by flying a known aircraft with correct FLARM registration. Monitor position data at [OGN's live page](https://live.glidernet.org/) during the flight to confirm the receiver captures signals. If detection fails, proceed to the debugging section below.

## FLARM Database Registration

Aircraft FLARM IDs must be correctly configured in both the club application and the [FLARM Device Database (DDB)](https://ddb.glidernet.org/) for automatic flight detection. The system matches OGN position data to club aircraft using the FLARM ID field in the aircraft record. Incorrect or missing FLARM IDs are the most common cause of automatic detection failures.

## Debugging Automatic Flight Detection

Automatic flight detection can fail for multiple reasons: configuration errors, hardware issues, or positioning problems. Systematic diagnosis isolates the failure point and identifies the appropriate fix.

### Verify Club Settings

**Airport configuration:** The system uses airport coordinates to determine when flights are at your airfield versus away landings. Incorrect coordinates cause the system to miss local flights or incorrectly assign away flights as local.

### Validate OGN Reception

**Third-party verification:** Use [OGN logbook](https://logbook.glidernet.org/) to verify OGN is receiving data from your aircraft independent of the club application.

1. Search for aircraft callsign or FLARM ID
2. Check recent flights appear with correct timestamps
3. If flights appear in OGN logbook but not in club application, the issue is configuration (FLARM ID mismatch, incorrect airport settings)
4. If flights do not appear in OGN logbook, the issue is hardware (receiver placement, FLARM not transmitting, DDB registration)

### Check FLARM ID Matching

**Aircraft-specific detection failure:** If some aircraft detect automatically but others do not, verify FLARM IDs. Compare FLARM ID in **Admin** → **Equipment** → Aircraft record with DDB entry at https://ddb.glidernet.org/.

### Assess Receiver Coverage

**Line-of-sight diagnosis:** If flights start appearing in OGN data at 200+ meters above the airfield, the receiver cannot see the launch point. This indicates a positioning problem rather than configuration error.

**Solutions for poor coverage:**
- Relocate receiver to higher mounting point with better horizon visibility
- Move receiver to mobile launch tower if airfield terrain allows
- Add second receiver to cover blind spots (requires additional hardware)
- Use "Automatic landing" mode if launch area coverage poor but landing area good
- Fall back to manual timekeeping if receiver placement cannot be improved

Airfields with multiple launch areas across significant terrain (hills, valleys) or dense tree lines present particular challenges. Mobile launch tower mounting often provides best results because the receiver moves with launch operations.
