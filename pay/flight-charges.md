# Flight Charges

## Overview

The GlidingApp provides a comprehensive and flexible billing system that adapts to your club's specific financial structure and requirements, streamlining financial operations while providing members with transparent and convenient payment options.




We had a couple of flights towards the end of 2026 where a club member let other members use his own glider for flights.  In this case the people who used it pay for the launches but not the flying time. -> manually change charge
