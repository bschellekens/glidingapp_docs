# About us

Born from necessity following EASA regulatory changes in 2020, the GlidingApp was created to help gliding clubs meet compliance challenges. We believe that glider pilots know best what gliding clubs need. As active members of the soaring community ourselves, we developed the GlidingApp from this perspective and further extended the functionality. We are committed to supporting it for as long as we remain in the air. Should our engagement end, all clubs receive the source code to ensure continuity, as per our [General terms and conditions](https://www.gliding.app/terms.html).

Our solution is delivered as a Software-as-a-Service with (semi)professional support, requiring little to no technical expertise from clubs to implement the GlidingApp correctly.

Since our successful launch in 2021, GlidingApp has been adopted by clubs across the Netherlands, Belgium, and England.

The GlidingApp is operated as a vof under ZweefApp (vof), registered in the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce, number 88819051.
